# Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST)

This project is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0–9).

## Project Overview
- Dataset: MNIST (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images)
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Model: CNN with 2 convolutional layers + dense layers
- Accuracy: ~98% on test data

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer.git
cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then open the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab and run all cells.

## Results

- Achieved ~98% accuracy on MNIST test data

- Correctly recognizes digits from 0–9
